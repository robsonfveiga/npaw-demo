## Case Study

Instead of delivering each component separately, I have developed an application that fulfills all requirements within a unified structure. Below is a brief guide to its **architecture and functionality**.

### Integration

The integration is primarily handled in the `services/npaw/plugins/NpawPluginService.ts` file. This class is responsible for:

- **Registering the player** for monitoring.
- **Configuring the adapter**, as different adapter settings are required for bitrates in **bp** and **Mbps**.
- **Monitoring JoinTime and Ping** to verify if the bitrate has changed successfully.

### API Usage

For API-related functionality, refer to the `services/npaw/api` directory, which contains multiple services:

- **API Connection Service** â€“ Manages the connection to the API.
- **Token Generation Service** â€“ Handles authentication by generating tokens.
- **URL Creation Service** â€“ Constructs request URLs dynamically.

### ðŸ“· Screenshot Request

ðŸ“Œ *Req: 1.2* â€“ Below is the requested screenshot:

## Main Panel

ðŸ“Œ *Req: 1.1* â€“ The **Main Panel** features a **VideoJS player** integrated with **NPAW** for monitoring and analytics.

---

## Side Panel â€“ Advanced Controls

To enhance interactivity and usability, a **Side Panel** with dynamic controls has been designed. Below is an overview of its sections:

### Bitrate
ðŸ“Œ *Req: 1.3 / 1.2*
- Displays the **current bitrate**, retrieved from `/ping` and `/JoinTime`.
- Includes a **button to change the bitrate** dynamically by updating the **adapter configuration**.

### Generate Token
ðŸ“Œ *Req: 2.1*
- Provides a **button to generate a token and URL**, fulfilling requirement **2.1**.

### Metrics Monitor
ðŸ“Œ *Req: 2.2*
- Allows selecting a **metric category** to display real-time server data.
- In the panel, it is also possible to verify the IP, as **all metrics use the user IP** as a **dimension to filter** the data.
- Includes a **countdown timer** indicating when the next request will fetch updated information.
